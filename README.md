# Instruction

1. Calculate the reflection coefficient using the function `calc_reflection_coefficient()`. Based on what `hit_break_results` of unreal gives us, the first function whose inputs require `start_pos`, and `end_pos` should be more suitable for your implementation.
2. Use the calculated reflection coefficient to calculate the signal strength using the function `calc_friss_strength()`. The function requires `starting position`, `ending position`, and `reflection_coefficient` as inputs.

Notes: I add several default values for some arguments in the functions. You can change them if you want. Also, I add some comments in the functions to help you understand the functions.
